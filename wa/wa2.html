    <h2>Hi, I'm Seneca!</h2>
    <img src="../img/seneca-concert.JPG" alt="Seneca at a concert" width="321" height="214">
    <p>I use <b>she/her</b> pronouns. I am a second-year junior at CU Boulder. I'm a CTD major and a Theatre minor.</p>
    <p>After taking this course, I hope that I will be confident enough to code a personal website for myself!</p>
    <p>As for more about me, I absolutely love rollercoasters/theme parks, a variety of video games, Dungeons and Dragons, and all kinds of music/concert-going.</p>
    <p>Another thing about me is that I am an official tester of Minecraft Championship! My favorite game in the tournament is called Sands of Time. A trailer of the game can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/n0NTKjqSsko?si=-6OPDvT4wuaUk3BV">here.</a></p>
    <p>If you want to look at the silly picture featured above separately, you can do so <a href="../img/seneca-concert.JPG">here.</a></p>
