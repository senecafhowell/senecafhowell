    <h2>Errors Found</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Error One - There was no html doctype declaration. To fix this, I added "!DOCTYPE html" in angle brackets to the top of the file.</li>
        <li>Error Two - The html lang attribute was called in the head instead of above the head. To fix this, I erased the original html lang line and moved it to be right below the initial DOCTYPE declaration.</li>
        <li>Error Three - There was no charset. To fix this, I added the charset UTF-8 in the head.</li>
        <li>Error Four - The head was not closed. To fix this, I added the "/head" tag in angle brackets to properly close it.</li>
        <li>Error Five - The h1 tag in line 22 of my file was not closed. To fix this, I added the "/h1" tag in angle brackets to properly close it.</li>
        <li>Error Six - The paragraph tag in line 25 of my file did not have an opening tag. To fix this, I added the "p" in angle brackets to properly open it.</li>
        <li>Error Seven - The list was opened with an "ol" tag and closed with a "ul" tag, which do not match. To fix this, I closed the list with "/ol" in angle brackets instead of "/ul" (which made it an ordered list).</li>
        <li>Error Eight - The paragraph tag in line 42 of my file did not have a closing tag. To fix this, I added the "/p" in angle brackets to properly close it.</li>
        <li>Error Nine - There was no alt text for the image. To fix this, I added the following alt text: "Meme: The Two States of Every Programmer - I am a God and I have no idea what I'm doing".</li>
        <li>Error Ten - The 48th line of code in my file was opened with "a" in angled brackets and closed with "/img," which did not match. To fix this, I changed the closing tag to "/a" in angle brackets.</li>
        <li>Error Eleven - In the table, the value of 25's closing tag did not have a forward slash. To fix this, I added "/"" to the closing "td" tag.</li>
        <li>Error Twelve - The table was not closed. To fix this, I added "/table" in angle brackets at the end of the table code.</li>
        <li>Error Thirteen - The image tag was trying to use "source". To fix this, I changed "source" to the proper term: "src". I also made the alt text a bit more descriptive.</li>
        <li>Error Fourteen - The center tag was being used, even though it's not valid in html5. To fix this, I added style="text-align:center;" to a paragraph tag.</li>
        <li>Error Fifteen - BGcolor was being used, even though it's not valid in html5. To fix this, I added style="background-color:lightgray;" to a paragraph tag.</li>
        <li>Error Sixteen - The comment was open. To fix this, I added "--" with an angle bracket to close the comment.</li>
        <li>Error Seventeen - There was no closing tag in line 82 of my file. To fix this, I added "/a" with angle brackets to close it.</li>
        <li>Error Eighteen - The tags were in the wrong order (and the words were italicized instead of underlined). To fix this, I put "/em" before "/p". Additionally, I switched to the "u" tag from the "em" tag to make it underlined and not italicized.</li>
        <li>Error Nineteen - The li tag was used incorrectly (this is a descriptive list). To fix this, I switched the "li" tags to "dt" ones (to make it a descriptive item title).</li>
        <li>Error Twenty - The li tag was used incorrectly (this is a descriptive list). To fix this, I switched the "li" tags to "dd" ones (to make it descriptive item text).</li>
        <li>Error Bonus - There was no meta name/content like in the other html files I have, so, while not necessary, I added them anyway.</li>
    </ol>
